# Introduction

For this project, I created a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the dslabs package is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. 

Recommendation system represents a classical application of machine learning technology. For example, for a movie recommendation system, the goal is to predict how a given user will rate a specific movie based on how the user rate other movies and how the movie is rated by other users.

In this project, I will combine several machine learning strategies to construct a movie recommendation system based on the "MovieLens" dataset. The full MovieLens dataset, which can be found here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/, is rather large. To make the computation easier, in this project I use the "10M" version of MovieLens dataset instead (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/). This 10M MovieLens dataset has around 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users.
